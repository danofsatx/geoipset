# geoipset
A project to dynamically create ipset sets from GeoIP databases, with
eventual goals of reading from journald/syslog.

Primarily aimed at RH based distros, with ties to fail2ban and firewalld.

A license hasn't been chosen yet, as the project is only in the planning stages,
and will depend on the license for both the GeoIP data and code snippets sourced
from other projects.
